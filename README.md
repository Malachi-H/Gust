# Gust
**A 2-dimensional vertical scrolling puzzle game.**

### Game Play
The player controls a feather moving it vertically through various levels and solving simple movement-related puzzles. The player relies on gusts of wind to gain height, slowly driftiing downwards when not pushed by wind. This mechanic encourages faster-paced movement by the player and punishes hesitation. Obstacles in the form of deadly clouds will impede the player's progress, causing the  level to  reset on contact with the player. While each level will be difficult to progress through on the first try, the deterministic game mechanics and timing will allow the player to gradually memorise each level to the point of rapid completion.

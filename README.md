# Gust
**A 2 dimensional vertical scrolling puzzle game.**
<sub>(title may change)</sub>

### Game Play
The player controls a feather moving it vertically through seamlessly transitioning levels, solving simple movement related puzzles. The player relies on gusts of wind to gain height and will slowly drift downwards. This mechanic encourages faster paced movement by the player and punishes hesitation. Obstacles in the form of crystalline snow flakes, slow falling stalactites and sections of rain will impede the players progress. While each level will be difficult to progress through on the first try, the deterministic game mechanics and timing will allow the player to gradually memories each levels to the point of rapid completion. To encourage this style of game-play, the time taken to complete each level is recorded and displayed, implicitly encouraging the player to complete the game in as little time as possible.
